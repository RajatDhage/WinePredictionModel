# WinePredictionModel
In this model we've performed Sentiment Analysis on the given dataset of Wine using Natural Language Processing. This will help to predict the variety of Wine with reference to the taste of the wine on which reviews of the user are dependent. From the dataset we can clearly see that users had given good reviews, while there is no negative impression of wine intake to the users. Therefore, it can be clearly seen that we need to have some sort of negative reviews to have balance between good and bad reviews so that our model performs better. We lack with negative reviews to have good predictions otherwise model is gonna crash.
## Top 5 Insights from the dataset that can be drawn are:
1. To predict variety of wine we need to focus on key Features such as user country and provinces of winery so that it'll be easier to predict Variety based on Location
2. We need to Perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to clean the data
3. We can predict variety of wine based on the location of winery and reviewer's country
4. We need to have strong command on NLP to process reviews and based on reviews predict variety of Wine
5. Price will impact less on prediction of the variety but yes it'll definitely have some relation with what kind of Wine user is drinking.
6. Points and reviews from users are interdependent so that it'll be better for us to have Sentiment Analysis of the Dataset.
